# 1. Current State 

We have spotted a gap in the market for a webshop where many types of cheeses are availible to order for delivery, thus not having to visit a retail store where there's no garuantee that you can find what you're looking for. For this reason we decided to create a webshop for just that. A beautiful, accessible webshop where a wide vareity of cheeses are availible for order.

# 2. Scope

Our vision is to have an online website, where we can sell our products to our customers without them having to travel to our shop. On this website they can browse all of our products in store and see details about them. After choosing their desired product, they have the option to purchase it on the website. After that, our team can see the order on the website, and manage it. The shipping process then can be done manually by one of our employees.

# 3. Standards & Laws


# 4. Current business model

Our team is currently in great obsession of cheese and because of this we have decided to open our own cheese webshop so we can share this love for cheese with other people. Our webshop is going to feature all kinds of cheese from the very common to the quite rare ones. If a customer is completely new to the world of cheese and can't decide which cheese to buy that's no problem either as the customers can contact us to recommend different types of cheese to them based on their taste and need.

Before we can release our webshop we will do our research on different cheese types in order for better understanding when categorizing or recommending them to customers. For example, our customer has access to a small variety of cheese because of not living im a major city or a bigger town. In this case our webshop is a great choice to try numerous types of cheese that the customer does not have access to for some reasons. Items can be easily ordered through our webshop so there's no need to travel far for experiencing new cheeses or just restocking.

From our point of view ordering an item online is a much more convenient way than taking any public transport to visit a store and spend maybe hours getting there and looking for the specific item the customer wants. Ordering cheeses online can come in handy especially if the customer doesn't have much free time because of work schedules for example. Of course the main advantage of online orders is not dealing with people on the way or in the store while looking for the perfect cheese roll.
