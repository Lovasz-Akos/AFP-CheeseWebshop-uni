# Requirement Specification


# 1. Introduction

We are a small, three man developer team aiming to create the greatest cheese shop anyone has ever seen. 
Our shared love for cheese lets us work together in a harmonic way, allowing us to achieve our goals 
faster and more efficiently. Our focus is currently on dynamic websites and webshops. 
We create these sites with the help of the Laravel framework, but we can use different technologies if needed.

# 2. Current State

We have studied the market for the last year and it is quite obvious that there is a market gap for a quality, accessible webshop that offers a wide vareity of cheesees. To meet this need in the market, we decided to create a website where you can browse our offerings and order cheese to be delivered right into the customer's hands.

# 3. Scope

Our vision is to have an online website, where we can sell our products to our customers without them having to travel to our shop. On this website they can browse all of our products in store and see details about them. After choosing their desired product, they have the option to purchase it on the website. After that, our team can see the order on the website, and manage it. The shipping process then can be done manually by one of our employees. Besides that, we would like to have a user management system where our customers can register, fill out their personal information like their name and shipping address, so they can purchase with their account easily.
