# Requirement Specification


# 1. Introduction

We are a small, three man developer team aiming to create the greatest cheese shop anyone has ever seen. 
Our shared love for cheese lets us work together in a harmonic way, allowing us to achieve our goals 
faster and more efficiently. Our focus is currently on dynamic websites and webshops. 
We create these sites with the help of the Laravel framework, but we can use different technologies if needed.
